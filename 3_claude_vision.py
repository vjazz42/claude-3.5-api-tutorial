Example of how to load a local image and send it to the Claude API.
We'll load an image AWS Lambda pricing table, then ask to generate a markdown table of the pricing information in the image.
We'll also ask to model the cost for 100, 1000, and 10000 users for a service that uses Lambda (with some assumptions).
